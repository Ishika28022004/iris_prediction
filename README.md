# iris_prediction
In this project, I developed an Iris Flower Classification web application using machine learning. I trained a classification model on the Iris dataset to predict the flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on user-inputted features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The model was integrated into a Flask web application, where users can enter feature values through a user-friendly interface. Upon prediction, the app displays the predicted flower name, confidence score, an image of the flower, along with personalized care suggestions and ideal climate information. This project demonstrates the end-to-end deployment of an ML model with interactive UI and real-world contextual insights
